# Purpose
  The goal of this project is to launch a balloon containing a payload that uses various sensors powered by an Arduino Mega to record variables from the environment at 100,000 feet. The program writes the outputs of all of these sensors to an 8 GB SD Card on the Arduino Mega itself. The Arduino Mega uses a solar panel to recharge its battery.
